StingRay's Totally Dark Theme for CWP

Looking for a way to override the default CSS for Centos Web Panel? Do you like Dark themes? Have you been looking for one that works with Centos Web Panel and Chrome extensions such as Stylish, Stylist, Dark Reader... etc don't seem to work with it, especially when accessing your server with SSL certificates?

Look no furtther!

This nifty little powerful script inverts the background and text of CWP while keeping the colors vibrant! Simply include the script in your script folder. You may have to chmod +x it before running it with sh. All it does is echo additional CSS rules and appends it to the CWP's admin custom.css file. So if ever the file gets updated and reverts back to the default style, you can run this script to get my dark theme back!

Works with Centos Web Panel 7, but should workk with Centos Web Panel as well.
